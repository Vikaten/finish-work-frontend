    <p class = "font1">The cream is suitable for dry skin - panthenol and squalane quickly restore it and return softness. Natural olive and avocado oils also give tenderness to your hands.

    <p class = "font2">The cream with the expressive aroma of figs, garden greens and cedar evokes images of fresh early morning, juicy ripe fruits and centuries-old pine forest. It moisturizes hands, nourishes the skin and makes it less sensitive to the environment thanks to its cumulative effect. The product is quickly absorbed, does not create an oily feeling and does not leave greasy marks on objects.</p>
